## Features

### Core Analysis
- **Fake Lossless Detection** — Identifies files that claim to be high-quality but are actually upsampled from lower bitrate sources by analyzing spectral content and effective frequency cutoff
- **Spectral Frequency Analysis** — FFT-based spectral analysis (4096-point, Hanning-windowed) determines the true effective frequency ceiling of your audio
- **Clipping Detection** — Digital clipping scan with percentage and sample-count reporting; thorough mode detects clipping even when audio has been scaled down by up to 0.5 dB, reported as "SCALED (dB, %)"
- **MQA Detection** — Identifies MQA and MQA Studio encoded files, reports original sample rate and encoder info
- **AI-Generated Audio Detection** — Scans metadata tags, raw byte patterns, and content provenance markers (C2PA) to identify AI-generated music from 20+ services including Suno, Udio, AIVA, Boomy, and Stable Audio. Features confidence scoring, false-positive filtering against known DAWs/encoders, AI watermark detection (AudioSeal, SynthID, WavMark), experimental spectral analysis (7 checks), and SH Labs API integration. The AI column reflects results from **all** enabled detection sources — standard, experimental, and SH Labs
- **Optimizer Detection** — Detects files that have been processed through audio "optimizers"
- **BPM Detection** — Algorithmic beat detection with tag-based BPM fallback
- **Replay Gain** — Extracts and displays Replay Gain metadata from tags
- **Comprehensive Metadata** — Artist, title, sample rate, bit depth, channels, duration, file size, and bitrate (reported vs. actual)
- **Fake Stereo Detection** — Detects mono-duplicated or artificially widened stereo files incorrectly labeled as stereo
- **True Peak Measurement** — Inter-sample true peak level (dBTP) using 4× oversampling, displayed in a dedicated column
- **LUFS Measurement** — Integrated loudness (LUFS / LKFS) per ITU-R BS.1770 with K-weighting
- **Rip/Encode Quality Detection (Experimental)** — Detects bad rips by analyzing zero-sector gaps, clicks/pops, stuck samples, and bit truncation. Opt-in via the feature config overlay
- **AcoustID Fingerprinting** — Identify unknown tracks via audio fingerprint against the AcoustID/MusicBrainz database; auto-downloads fpcalc
- **Improved Bitrate Analysis** — Avoids simplistic "320 kbps" labeling for files with steep lowpass filters using a band-energy-drop method; lossless formats (FLAC/WAV/AIFF/APE/WV) report their actual file data rate instead of a lossy-equivalent estimate
- **Custom FLAC Decoder** — Managed FLAC decoder handles files that NAudio cannot decode natively, ensuring full analysis and playback coverage
- **Full Metadata Editor** - Full menu for editing, adding, or removing metadata in an audiofile including search buttons to auto search for the metadata for you
- **Update Checker** — Optionally silently checks for updates in the background each time the program starts

- Click any service button with a track selected to instantly search for it online

### AI Detection (BETA)

AudioAuditor's AI detection tries its best to use **verifiable evidence** - However that being said, these results **can be inacurate**, regardless **please do not use these finding to defame or harrass anyone** :)

| Method | What It Checks |
|--------|---------------|
| **Metadata Tags** | ID3v2, Vorbis, APE, M4A tags for AI service markers (TXXX frames, comments, encoder fields, free-form atoms) |
| **Raw Byte Patterns** | First 128KB, middle 32KB, and last 128KB of the file for embedded identifiers |
| **C2PA / Content Credentials** | JUMBF box markers, claim manifests, and provenance data |
| **AI Watermarks** | AudioSeal, SynthID, and WavMark watermark identifiers |
| **Confidence Scoring** | Strong markers (named services) score higher than generic phrases; minimum 0.4 threshold required |
| **False-Positive Filtering** | Files produced by known DAWs (Audacity, FL Studio, Ableton, etc.) or encoders (LAME, FFmpeg, etc.) have weak generic markers filtered out |
| **SH Labs API (Opt-in)** | Cloud-based AI speech detection via SH Labs; requires privacy consent and is rate-limited |


### Export & Reporting

Five export formats, all matching the current DataGrid column layout:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Excel (.xlsx)** | Styled workbook with colored status cells, auto-fit columns, frozen header row |
| **CSV (.csv)** | Standard comma-separated values with proper escaping |
| **Text (.txt)** | Formatted report with box-drawing characters, per-file details, and summary statistics |
| **PDF (.pdf)** | Multi-page PDF with monospaced text layout |
| **Word (.docx)** | Minimal OOXML document with bold headers and summary |

All columns exported including: Status, Title, Artist, File Name, File Path, Sample Rate, Bit Depth, Channels, Duration, File Size, Reported Bitrate, Actual Bitrate, Format, Max Frequency, Clipping, Clipping %, BPM, Replay Gain, Dynamic Range, MQA, MQA Encoder, AI Detection, Fake Stereo, Silence, Date Modified, Date Created, True Peak, LUFS, Rip Quality.

### Queue System
- Dedicated queue window for managing playback order
- Add tracks from the grid via context menu or toolbar button
- Drag-and-drop reordering support
- Auto-advance through the queue

### Integrations
- **Discord Rich Presence** — Shows currently playing track, artist, elapsed time, and song duration bar in your Discord status. Fetches album art from Last.fm when available. Includes play/pause state icons and automatic reconnection (toggle in Settings)
- **Last.fm Scrobbling** — Full authentication flow with browser-based token exchange, Now Playing updates, and automatic scrobbling at 50% or 4 minutes (whichever comes first)
- **Windows Media Session (SMTC)** — Publishes now-playing info to System Media Transport Controls so media overlays (FluentFlyout, volume OSD, etc.) display the current track and album art

### Performance Controls
- **Configurable CPU usage limit** — Choose from Auto (Balanced), Low (2 threads), Medium (4 threads), High (8 threads), or Maximum (16 threads) in Settings
- Auto CPU mode defaults to half your logical processors (clamped 1–16) for a balanced experience
- **Configurable memory limit** — Choose from Auto (Balanced), Low (512 MB), Medium (1 GB), High (2 GB), Very High (4 GB), or Maximum (8 GB)
- Auto memory mode defaults to 25% of your total system RAM (clamped 512–8192 MB)
- When memory usage approaches the configured limit, AudioAuditor automatically pauses processing, triggers garbage collection, and waits for memory to free up before continuing
- Both limits apply to file analysis and spectrogram batch export
- Prevents CPU and memory spikes that could lag or freeze your system when processing large folders

### Theming

10 carefully crafted themes with full UI consistency:

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Dark** | Classic dark mode with subtle grey tones |
| **Ocean** | Deep navy blues inspired by the sea |
| **Light** | Clean light mode with crisp contrast |
| **Amethyst** | Rich purple tones |
| **Dreamsicle** | Warm orange and cream |

## Data & Privacy

AudioAuditor is designed with privacy in mind:

| Data | Storage | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| Theme preference | `theme.txt` | `%AppData%\AudioAuditor\` |
| Settings & options | `options.txt` | `%AppData%\AudioAuditor\` |
| Last.fm credentials | `session.dat` | `Documents\AudioAuditor\` |
| Analyzed file data | Memory only | Not persisted — cleared on exit |
| Audio queue | Memory only | Not persisted — cleared on exit |
| Spectrograms | Memory only | Only saved if user explicitly exports |

Stored settings include: theme names, boolean flags, service slot names, custom URLs/icons, EQ gains, concurrency/memory limits. No sensitive data in this file. Last.fm session keys are stored separately in your Documents folder.

- **No telemetry or analytics** — zero network calls except when you click a music service search button, use Discord Rich Presence, or scrobble to Last.fm
- **Minimal Disk Usage files and cache** — Only small settings files and temporary archive extractions are written to disk. Analysis data lives in memory and temp files are cleaned up automatically.
- **No logging** — no log files are created
- **Zero AI Training** - nothing analyzed/played is *ever* used to train generative AI
